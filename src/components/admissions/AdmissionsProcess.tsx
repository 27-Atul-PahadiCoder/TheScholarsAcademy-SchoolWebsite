          The admission process at The Scholar's Academy is transparent and
          student-centric. We evaluate applicants based on their academic
          performance, aptitude, and potential for growth. The process typically
          includes submission of application forms, entrance examinations, and
          personal interviews to ensure the right fit between student and
          school.
